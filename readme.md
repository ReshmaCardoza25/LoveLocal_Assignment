# Logic for easy1.c
**User Input:**
   - The program uses `fgets` to get a string input from the user, allowing for spaces in the input.
**Traverse Backward:**
   - It traverses the string backward, skipping trailing spaces at the end.
**Count Last Word:**
   - It counts the characters of the last word, stopping at a space or the beginning of the string, and returns the count as the result.


# Logic for medium3.c
**Memory Allocation:**
   - Allocates memory for a 2D array to store intermediate results.
**Matrix Traversal:**
   - Iterates through each matrix element, applying dynamic programming.
**Dynamic Programming Logic:**
   - Computes the size of the largest square of 1's using a dynamic programming approach.
**User Input Handling:**
   - Takes user input for matrix dimensions and elements.
**Memory Deallocation:**
   - Frees dynamically allocated memory to prevent memory leaks.


# Logic for hard1.c
**Deque Initialization:**
   - Allocates memory for a deque to store indices of elements within the sliding window.
**Sliding Window Processing:**
   - Iterates through the array, updating the deque with relevant indices to maintain the maximum element in the current window.
**Result Calculation:**
   - Calculates the result array by extracting the maximum element from the deque for each sliding window.
**Memory Management:**
   - Allocates and frees memory for the result array and the deque to ensure efficient memory usage.
**User Input Handling:**
   - Takes user input for array size, elements, and sliding window size. Displays input array and sliding window size along with the calculated output.
